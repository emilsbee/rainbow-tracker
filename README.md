# Rainbow tracker

## About the app
Rainbow tracker is a personal time tracker web application. It facilitates tracking your life in 15-minute intervals using user-defined categories and activities. You can also write notes next to the categories/activities to further elaborate on what you were doing at that point. With convenient dragging functionality for categories/activities and notes, logging your time becomes super easy. Furthermore, there is an evolving analytics page to view the various statistics of how you have spent your time. And of course, you can edit the categories and activities to fit what exactly you spend time on. 

## Explore the application
Currently it is possible to explore the application using the test account. So head over to [rainbow.emils.xyz](https://rainbow.emils.xyz) and use the credentials:
- email: `user@test.com`
- password: `password`

The test account already has some data to play around with. The data ir reset every day so any edits you have made will be cleared.

## Feature showcase

### Main dashboard

Main dashboard is where all the logging of time happens. Each column represents a day and each row represents a 15-minute interval. As seen in the video, dragging both categories and notes makes it really convenient and quick to log what you have done during the day.

### Analytics

In analytics you can view your data over time in various different formats. As seen in the video, currently weekly and daily analytics are available. This means that data is aggregated either per week or per each week day. Many new graphs are to be implemented for even more extensive analytics possibilities.
